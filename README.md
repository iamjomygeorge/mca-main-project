# Inkling

The Standard for Digital Literary Assets

A blockchain-based platform designed to establish trust, ownership, and provenance in the digital publishing industry. Inkling functions as a platform for authors to secure their work on an immutable ledger and as a digital library where readers can own and read verifiable literary works. The project's goal is to create a decentralized literary marketplace that guarantees the authenticity and ownership of digital assets.
